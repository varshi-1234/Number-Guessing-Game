==========================

Sample solution for the [number-guessing-game](https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game) challenge from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh).

## Introduction
---------------

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This is a simple command-line game where you have to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game has three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, each with a different number of attempts to guess the correct number.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/varshi-1234/Number-Guessing-Game-Python.git
   cd number-guessing-game-python
   
2. **Run the Game**
   
   python number_guessing_game.py

## How to Play
--------------

1. Run the game using the command above.
2. You will be presented with a welcome message and a prompt to select the difficulty level.
3. Choose the difficulty level by entering 1 for Easy, 2 for Medium, or 3 for Hard.
4. Once you've selected the difficulty level, you will be prompted to enter your guess.
5. Enter a number between 1 and 100.
6. If your guess is incorrect, you will receive a hint indicating whether the correct number is higher or lower than your guess.
7. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number or run out of attempts.

## Difficulty Levels
-------------------

* **Easy**: 10 attempts to guess the correct number.
* **Medium**: 5 attempts to guess the correct number.
* **Hard**: 3 attempts to guess the correct number.

## Technical Details

### Requirements

Python 3.x

### Code Structure

The code is contained in a single Python file:

number_guessing_game.py: Contains all the game logic, including difficulty selection, input handling, and result display.
